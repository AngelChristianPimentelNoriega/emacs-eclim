h2. OVERVIEW

Eclim is an Eclipse plugin which exposes Eclipse features through a
server interface.  When this server is started, the command line utility
eclim can be used to issue requests to that server.

Eclim can be found at http://eclim.sourceforge.net/.

h2. INSTALLATION

Get the installer for your platform from the Eclim downloads page and
follow those instructions.  After the install procedure, you should have
the eclim and eclimd executables in

<pre>
$ECLIPSE_HOME/eclimd
$ECLIPSE_HOME/plugins/org.eclim_1.4.5/bin/eclim
</pre>

It might be convenient to drop a shellscript like

<pre>
#!/bin/sh
$ECLIPSE_HOME/plugins/org.eclim_1.4.5/bin/eclim $*
</pre>

into your PATH.

h2. USAGE

To start using eclim, first you have to start the eclimd server process.
Here are two possibilities:

  1. Simply execute the eclimd executable.  This will start a headless
     eclipse instance in the background, so you have to do all your work
     in emacs.

  2. Start Eclipse as usual and open the eclimd view, which starts the
     server, too.

             Show View -> Other -> Eclim -> eclimd

h2. Contributing

The project is pretty new and needs a lot of work. If you have some spare time and want to help us improve java development on emacs, just fork the project and send me a pull-request, once you want me to merge it back into the repository.
